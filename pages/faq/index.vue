        <h2>The Weapon of Aphelios</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Calibrum</b> - This is a sniper rifle that deals long-range damage to enemies. When Aphelios attacks with
          Calibrum, he marks the enemy, and can then attack them again with a homing missile that deals bonus damage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Severum</b> - This is a healing weapon that Aphelios can use to restore his own health. When Aphelios
          attacks with Severum, he gains a temporary shield and heals for a portion of the damage dealt.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Gravitum</b> - This is a utility weapon that Aphelios can use to slow down enemies and root them in place.
          When Aphelios attacks with Gravitum, he roots the enemy in place and also slows down other nearby enemies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Infernum</b> - This is an AOE weapon that deals damage to multiple enemies at once. When Aphelios attacks
          with Infernum, he creates a cone-shaped blast that deals damage to all enemies in the area.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Crescendum</b>- This is a chakram weapon that can be used to deal damage to multiple enemies at once. When
          Aphelios attacks with Crescendum, he throws out a chakram that deals damage to all enemies in its path. If he
          picks up the chakram again, he can throw it out again for extra damage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Aphelios can only have two weapons equipped at any given time, and he can switch between them using his Q
          ability. Each weapon has its own unique passive ability, and Aphelios must strategize which weapons to use in
          different situations in order to be most effective in battle.
